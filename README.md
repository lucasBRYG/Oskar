# oskar
A personalized assitant and portal homepage for your browser.



### Introduction
I started with the idea for just a simple planner. Then I watched Iron Man and wanted someone like JARVIS or Friday that would be a little tech assitant. I'm no guy named Anthonty, but I figured it wouldn't be so far off to add a few features and make it friendly like a good robot. And so bore OSKAR(acronym pending) from my mental loins. Right now, I want him to be able to tell you about the weather and your schedule. Thow in a search bar and some local memory usage and OSKAR will be basically a better homescreen for your browser.
