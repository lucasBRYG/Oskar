Worked on the github repo a bit. Gonna try to link github to trello board and work a bit on weather-dashboard component.
At this point I have a general idea of the style I want, but it's susceptible to change. For now I'm going to create the comoponents individually, styled after android widgets. I susspect this could bite me in the butt when I try to puzzle them all together. But what can I say, I don't mind agressive foreplay...
