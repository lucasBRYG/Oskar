.1: I'm torn between just making separate calls for the weather and finding a new weather API. Had the idea for maybe having there be an API call when the user enters their info, getting the lon and lat when they enter their location and storing it in local storage. I don't love this, because it doesn't really seem scalable. Like if we want to change location, or store multiple cities, we would have to make a call each time and hit local storage a bunch. Seems inelegant
