#### 3.21.21

.1: Gonna build the state object for weather component, maybe start connecting state with API call.

.2: So for now I'm going to scrap the whole hourly weather thing. I should be able to add that pretty simply...

.3: ...The thing about that is I hate it. I really feel like if im looking for info about the weather today, I want to know what the weather is now and what it will look like for the rest of the day. So instead, im gonna shrink the info to be grabbed. For current: temp, description, icon, and date/time. Hourly: icon and temp/3 hours. Future days: temp, description, icon, date.

.4: Gonna build a little weather object that can be used in the weather component when setting state.
