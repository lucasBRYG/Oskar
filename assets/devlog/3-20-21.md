#### 3.20.21

.1: I found something through a little research: openweather can suck an egg.
Not really, I’m actually super grateful to openweather and their API. It’s free, and has pretty good documentation. But the whole using lat lon for their most useful API is a bummer.

.2: I’ve decided to go with the 5 day, 3 hour forecast API. It will require some internal logic to parse out the useful stuff, but it will save on actually making calls. Now I can just put out one call and get the current weather and forecast all at once. The downside is the data comes in this huge array of objects with unix UTC time codes. I figure I either need an algorithm that will sort out the weather data  based on position in the array, or an algorithm to interpret UTC timestamps so I can pull out the data.

.3: I'm leaning towards having the weather being loaded into the state of the weather component when it mounts, and then we can pass the state along to the different internal components to be rendered.
