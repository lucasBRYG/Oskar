#### 3.23.21

.1: I need to figure out the unix timestamp thing before I do much else. I still need to do the CSS but I'm leaning towards getting the data moving around to all 3 coponents before worying about styling. So without further ado, let's learn about unix.

.2: So I procrastinated pretty bad today... didn't do much. But I did manage to come up with an easy work around for the unix timestamp conversversion. The Date object in JS can take in a unix timestamp in milliseconds, i.e. unixTimestamp * 1000. And it will come out already in the users timezone, or at it will go off whatever the computer's internal timezone setting is. Shouldn't be too hard to come up with an algorithm to make the hour components.

.3: Running into some bugs trying to get the Hourly components to render. Maybe I'm doing it wrong but it's going to be a pain tracking down what's wrong with it
