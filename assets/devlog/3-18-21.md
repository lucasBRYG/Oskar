.1: Hit a big ol' brick wall on the whole trello-github marriage thing. That's fine, working on getting openweather API working. 

.2: Did some research about the openweather API. Unless I'm missing something I'm going to need to either make seperate calls for the current and future weather, or figure out a way of getting the user's longitude and latitude. The Google Geolocator or whatever API could do that for me, but then I'm making multiple calls so what's the good in it...
